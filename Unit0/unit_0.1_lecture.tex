\item \textit{Discourse on the Method}\footnote{Discours de la Méthode Pour bien conduire sa raison, et chercher la vérité dans les sciences, 1637}
\begin{itemize}
\item ``I think, therefore I am.''  The method of starting with doubt and finding one concrete thing in which to place belief, before moving forward.
\item Offers three proofs of the existence of God
\end{itemize}
\item An appendix to The Discourse was entitled \textit{Geometry}, which unified algebra and geometry.  This method of translating geometric areas and volumes into algebraic equations was unique and new at the time.  From this moment we get the notion of a coordinate system: Cartesian coordinates
\item Also discussed cosmology, optics, and the psychology of emotions

Some vocabulary:
\begin{enumerate}
\item Epistemology: the theory of the origin of knowledge, distinguishing justified belief from opinion
\item Rationalism: the theory that reason rather than experience is the foundation of certainty in knowledge
\item Empiricism: the theory that all knowledge is derived from sensory experience, stimulated by the rise of experimental science
\item Theology: the study of the nature of God and religious belief, systematically developed
\end{enumerate}

Empiricism: epistemology based on sensory experience.

\item Clearly has implications for experimental science
\item Modern science (physics) is divided into two poles: \textit{theoretical} and \textit{experimental}
\item Mathematics can be grouped into various categories as well (some didn't exist at the time).

Other Catholic terminology:
\begin{enumerate}
\item Diocese: A district under the pastoral care of a bishop.  A diocese may have several churches or a cathedral, in which people worship.
\item Monastery: A place where those who have taken religious vows (think monks and nuns) live and work.
\item The Society of Jesus (Jesuits): A religious order that played a significant international role in education
\item The Dominican Order: A religious order primarily known for scholastic tradition and preaching the gospel, dealing with heresy
\item Heresy: When a person spreads an idea counter to the teaching of Christ.  For example, the Arian heresy took place in first few centuries in Church history.  The Emperor Constantine attempted to settle the question at the Council of Nicea, from which we get the Nicean Creed.

\end{enumerate}
\item Virreinato del Per\'{u}, comprised of former Incan capital and territory
\begin{enumerate}
\item Captial: Lima, Per\'{u}.  The original capital of the Incans was Cusco.  \textit{Note: Incan empire was the largest in the world at the time.}
\end{enumerate}
\item Virreinato de Nueva Granada (from Per\'{u})
\begin{enumerate}
\item Capital: Santa Fe de Bogot\'{a}, modern Bogot\'{a}, Colombia
\item Caracas and Quito are also within this province
\end{enumerate}
\item Virreinato del R\'{i}o De la Plata (from Per\'{u})

\section{Vocabulary: Nahuatl and Espa\~{n}ol}

\begin{frame}{Vocabulary}
\small
Nahuatl vocabulary\footnote{The letter x makes a sound much like the English ``h,'' as in \textit{M\'{e}xico} or \textit{Oaxaca}.}:
\begin{enumerate}
\item \textbf{Nahua}: main ethnic group indigenous to Mexico.  The Aztecs were of Nahua ethnicity.  Around 500 BC, settled in the basin in central Mexico.
\item \textbf{Nahautl}: a language group of the Nahua
\item \textbf{altepetl}: a Nahua city-state within which most individuals were of the same tribe and ethnicity.  Sub-unit: \textbf{calpolli.}
\item \textbf{amoxtli}: a codex or book written in Nahuatl
\item \textbf{tlacuiloll}: a painting or stelae
\item \textbf{tlacuilo}: one who paints or records, a notary or scribe
\end{enumerate}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Vocabulary}
\small
Nahuatl vocabulary\footnote{The letter x makes a sound much like the English ``h,'' as in \textit{M\'{e}xico} or \textit{Oaxaca}.}:
\begin{enumerate}
\item \textbf{Nahuatl list of animals}: \url{http://www.native-languages.org/nahuatl_animals.htm}. \textit{Nota bene: la historia del tecolote y mi suegra.  B\'{u}ho o tecolote?}
\item \textbf{Abuizotl}: river otter.  Cases like these are interesting because the European colonials had likely never encountered such a species.  Another example is the Andean condor, a bird of prey called \textit{Vultur gryphus}, an amalgamation of indigenous and latin words.  It's not a vulture, but like one, and condor comes from \textit{quechua.}
\end{enumerate}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Vocabulary}
\small
\begin{enumerate}
\item \textbf{Huitzilin}: hummingbird.  A discussion of Linnaean classification and indigenous language will be necessary (see Ch. 1).  This species is completely restricted to the New World, so it would have been totally unknown to colonials.
\begin{itemize}
\item quetzal huitzilin (a quetzal is not a hummingbird)
\item xi huitzilin ... turquiose hummingbird
\item chalchi huitzilin ... light greed hummingbird
\item yiauhtic huitzilin ... purple hummingbird
\item tlapal huitzilin ... mixed black hummingbird
\item aiopal huitzilin ... light purple hummingbird
\item tle huitzilin ... hot coal colored hummingbird
\item quapa huitzilin ... tawny yellow hummingbird
\end{itemize}
The story of hummingbird ``resurrection,'' that leads to the Nahua belief that hummingbirds are symbols of the warrior and immortality.
\end{enumerate}

\end{figure}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Vocabulary}
\small
\begin{enumerate}
\item \textbf{Xilo, xiloxochitl}: balsam, balsam tree.  A general term for residue extracted from tree matter that has medicinal properties.  The word balsam comes from The Balm of Gilead, in the Hebrew Bible (Genesis) for a region currently in Jordan.  Why did the Spanish colonials refer to \textit{xilo} as balsam?
\item \textbf{tzipipatli}: an herb native to Nueva Espa\~{n}a used to treat diarrhea.  Compare to how the Europeans treated diarrhea.  What is to be learned from the different treatments?
\end{enumerate}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Vocabulary}
\small
Spanish vocabulary:
\begin{enumerate}
\item \textbf{Sacerdote}: Catholic priest, often used as translators, transcribers, naturalists, and explorers in addition to evangelizing and building churches
\end{enumerate}
