Some vocabulary:
\begin{enumerate}
\item Epistemology: the theory of the origin of knowledge, distinguishing justified belief from opinion
\item Rationalism: the theory that reason rather than experience is the foundation of certainty in knowledge
\item Empiricism: the theory that all knowledge is derived from sensory experience, stimulated by the rise of experimental science
\item Theology: the study of the nature of God and religious belief, systematically developed
\end{enumerate}

Other Catholic terminology:
\begin{enumerate}
\item Diocese: A district under the pastoral care of a bishop.  A diocese may have several churches or a cathedral, in which people worship.
\item Monastery: A place where those who have taken religious vows (think monks and nuns) live and work.
\item The Society of Jesus (Jesuits): A religious order that played a significant international role in education
\item The Dominican Order: A religious order primarily known for scholastic tradition and preaching the gospel, dealing with heresy
\item Heresy: When a person spreads an idea counter to the teaching of Christ.  For example, the Arian heresy took place in first few centuries in Church history.  The Emperor Constantine attempted to settle the question at the Council of Nicea, from which we get the Nicean Creed.
