\maketitle

\begin{abstract}
This course will follow the standard methodology of elementary statistics taught regularly during Fall and Spring semesters. Concepts of descriptive statistics will be presented, including descriptive measures, probability concepts, discrete random variables, and the normal distribution. Concepts of inferential statistics will also be presented, including sampling distributions, confidence intervals, hypothesis testing, chi-squared procedures, and linear regression. This version of the course will provide interactive learning techniques designed to augment the online learning experience, and the course textbook will be free.  Time-permitting, the use of computer programming tools to help visualize examples will be covered.

\textit{\textbf{Grading}: There will be one midterm, one final exam, and daily warm-up quizzes.  There will also be homework from the textbook, submitted via Moodle.  Finally, there will be a self-designed project and presentation given at the end of the term.

\textit{\textbf{Policy due to COVID-19}: Our course is an online summer course, so there is no additional risk of transmission from person-to-person contact.  However, we do note some policies that should be helpful:
\begin{enumerate}
\item Class will meet \textit{synchronously} for \textbf{up to 90 minutes} using the Zoom web-conferencing application, at the normal class time.  Class time will be used to work through a daily warm-up quiz together, along with whiteboard solution via Zoom.  The warm up will be followed by traditional lecture content and interactive examples and activities.  \textbf{We will reach consensus in the first days of class as to the exact start time of the daily synchronous portion of the course.}  This is to accommodate those who have class conflicts, work, or family obligations at home.
\item Group project results will be \textbf{presented via Zoom} during the last week of class.
\item \textbf{Students may opt-out of taking the final exam.}  In order to accommodate students' preparation for the Fall semester, the final exam is optional.  If one does not take it, the assignment weights for the final grade will be those given in Tab. \ref{tab:grades} (right).
\end{enumerate}}

\textit{\textbf{Course Objectives}:}
\begin{itemize}
\item To practice written and oral expression of technical ideas.

\1 \textbf{Final exam, August 14th, 2020.} The final exam is optional.  If a student feels he or she needs to take it to shore up a grade, then it is recommended.
\1 \textit{Final Project and Presentation details:}
Students will perform data collection and analysis on a topic of their choice, with the goal of establishing a linear correlation.  Often times this portion of the project is more art than science, since many experiments do not turn out a linear dependence.  Students must submit a \textit{project summary} by July 31st, 2020 so that the instructor may modify it or make suggestions.  The data should be collected, along with statistical errors on the measurements.  Students will then perform a linear regression on the data, and attempt to make a sound statistical prediction using the regression.  The final presentation should be 7-12 slides in PDF or PowerPoint format, which will be presented remotely to the class via Zoom in the final week of class.  In addition to the technical correctness of the conclusions, students will be assessed on the clarity of the presentation.  \textbf{As such, the instructor will provide practice sessions, training, and advice on presentation of the topic by appointment with the students.}
