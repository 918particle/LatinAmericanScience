\begin{abstract}
The scientific attitude exists in all human cultures, as does the desire to understand the natural world.  This course focuses on the scientific, medical, mathematical, and engineering practices of the Maya, Aztec, Inca, Colonial, and Modern Latin American civilizations.  The evolution covered in this course begins in the 1700s, when Mayan, Aztec, and Incan scientific practices were combined with the principles of the European Enlightenment by Latin American Creoles.  Independence from Spain and Portugal were secured in the 19th century.  This nationalist transition was closely connected to the freedom to create scientific progress, and to spread modern education throughout Latin American territory.  Science and technology became omnipresent in 20th century Latin America, as it did in the United States and Europe.  In this course, we will first develope a historically-motivated definition for the scientific attitude.  Next, we will engage with the history of Latin American science through detailed discussions of essays exploring natural history, medicine and public health, the Enlightenment, and contemporary physics and astronomy research.  Class sessions will include activities that illustrate and enhance our understanding of diverse topics, from pre-Columbian mathematics to modern Latin American research. Finally, students will create digital stories that showcase pre-Columbian, Enlightement period, and modern scientific research from Latin America.
