\item European (French) scientists had established a lower limit on the latitude auroras could be observed: 35 degrees North of the Equator.
\item The Mexican scientists observed the aurora at 16.8 degrees North
\item Like modern scientists, they did not stop at observation but attempted to explain with a theoretical model

\section{More on Mexican Astronomers}

\begin{frame}{More on Mexican Astronomers}
\textbf{Where were the auroras?}
\begin{enumerate}
\item Sir Edmond Halley thought that the magnetized matter was radiating from the poles of the Earth.  This was a valid hypothesis because \textit{no one had ever been to the poles.}
\item Benjamin Franklin thought that the origin was terrestrial electricity.
\item Jean-Jacques Dortous de Mairan: matter from the the Sun's atmosphere, and believed it was \textit{above} our atmosphere
\end{enumerate}

\item Benjamin Franklin thought that the origin was terrestrial electricity.
\item Jean-Jacques Dortous de Mairan: matter from the the Sun's atmosphere, and believed it was \textit{above} our atmosphere.  He associated it with Zodiacal light.
\end{enumerate}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{More on Mexican Astronomers}
\textbf{Where were the auroras observable?}
\begin{enumerate}
\item Mairan and Le\'{o}n y Gama thought it was only observable along certain angles
\begin{itemize}
\item Mairan associated it with Zodiacal light, Le\'{o}n y Gama thought it was associated with the \textit{ether}.
\item Alzate y Ram\'{i}rez collected observations from multiple cities and locations to determine the geometry of the ring (radius of $\approx 4000$ km.
\end{itemize}
\item Alzate y Ram\'{i}rez predicted the aurora would have been observed in other countries, including Spain, and as far away as Russia.  Spanish observations proved him right.
\item Le\'{o}n y Gama located a reference suggesting indigenous observations of auroras in 1602 (Juan de Torquemada).
\end{enumerate}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{More on Mexican Astronomers}

\textbf{What was an aurora?}
\begin{enumerate}
\item Alzate y Ram\'{i}rez linked observations from many cities to one event, rather than treating them as individual events
\item Le\'{o}n y Gama noted that the same aurora could present differently in different locations due to variation in local conditions: (1) one event many observations (2) size variation (regular, grande etc.) (3) local conditions could change the form and colors ... \textit{encendida}.
\item Le\'{o}n y Gama concluded that they were higher than the atmosphere because he thought the atmosphere ended far lower than it does, and gave examples for all the phenomena we know and the typical altitude above sea level
\item Le\'{o}n y Gama thus decided that sense there appeared to be a correlation with the Moon's phase, that it was the Moon exciting the ether, though our atmosphere determines the colors.  Altitude calculation: 460 - 512 km

\textbf{What was an aurora?}
\begin{enumerate}
\item Experiments of Jos\'{e} Francisco Dimas Rangel
\begin{itemize}
\item Watchmaker, engineer
\item Invited (along with Alzate and Le\'{o}n y Gama) to the coure of the viceroy for scientific meetings
\item These meetings were organized by \textit{Joaq\'{i}n Vel\'{a}zquez C\'{a}rdenas de Le\'{o}n} ... Astronomer who with d'Autoroche recorded Venus transits in Baja California. C\'{a}rdenas de Le\'{o}n was also director of Royal Tribunal of Minerals
\item Dimas Rangel occasionally published anonomously (like others)
\item \textbf{\alert{Presented an experimental design to replicate effects of aurora}}
\item It was basically a fluorescent light (current through rarified gas in a glass tube) ... before 1800 ...
\item Balmer transition (red like aurora)
\end{itemize}

\section{Transition to Expeditions and Exploration}

\begin{frame}{More on Mexican Astronomers}
\begin{enumerate}
\item The Mexican astronomers were dealing with uncertainties in angular observations.
\item They were also dealing with cartographic uncertainties (see board).
\item Could get anywhere from infinity height or 100 km for altitude of aurora.
\item \textbf{How are latitudes and longitudes measured?} How do you determine how far away an object is located, when you live in the 1700s and 1800s?
